    This essay is intended to answer (very briefly) to a question: \emph{What is programming?}
    Although computer programs nowadays are pretty ubiquitous in nature, they remain being \emph{black boxes of magic}
    for most people, even tech-savvy ones. \par

    However, being a \emph{black box of magic} to some extent is a requirement for some commercial software (especially when there are trade secrets involved) 
    natural. But this essay is not intended to answer how every software works in details, but \emph{how every software works, in general}. \par
